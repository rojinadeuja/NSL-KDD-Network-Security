### Dataset: 
NSL-KDD Dataset [https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html]

### Summary:
Intrusion detection is the task of monitoring various events that occur in a computer system or a communication network, and analyzing them for signs of intrusions. 
The NSL-KDD dataset is a benchmark dataset used to design and evaluate various intrusion detection systems. 
In this project, we analyze various parameters that characterize a network system and design an **Intrusion Detection** model to identify vulnerable systems.
